Simple repo with 2 finetunes of codebert for cybersecurity related tasks.

Finetuned model: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/codebert-base

First task uses CSIC 2010 Web Application Attacks dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ispangler/csic-2010-web-application-attacks/data

Second task uses malicious url dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/malicious-urls-dataset

On both tasks, a finetuned codebert quickly obtains around 99% accuracy.
